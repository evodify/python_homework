# GSI calculation

This script calculates genealogical sorting index (GSI) for a given group/groups on trees in the multi-newick file. It iterates through all the trees in a file and outputs GSIs for each tree as well as it summarizes the results with a histogram.

Summarizing the variation in the phylogenetic signal along the genome is problematic due to  large set of trees with varying topology. Often the results of phylogenetic sliding window analysis is visualized with [DensiTree](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~remco/DensiTree/) :

Such images (example is taken from [Kryvokhyzha, 2014] (http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-243477)) allows to make some subjective conclusions. For example, on the prevailing topology in the genome or blurred relationships between some groups.

However, often researches are interested in quantitative evaluation of different phylogenetic hypotheses. GSI allows such quantitative estimation of the degree of exclusive ancestry of a groups of interest.

For more detail on GSI see: [Cummings et al. 2008. A Genealogical Approach to Quantifying Lineage Divergence. Evolution, Vol. 62, No 9. pp.2411-2422](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00442.x/full)

**Input files example:**

Phylogenetic trees in a multi-newick file (tree.nwk):
```
((((a1,a2),(a3,a4)),((b1,b2),b3)),b4);
(((a1,a2),(a3,a4)),((b1,b2),(b3,b4)));
((((a1,a2),(b3,a4)),a3),((b1,b2),b4));
```

Tree names/coordinates on the genome (tree.names):
```
tree1
tree2
tree3
```

**Output files example:**

GSI for every tree and group (tree.out):
```
TreeName    gr1 gr2
tree1   1.0 0.5625
tree2   1.0 1.0
tree3   0.5625  0.125
```
Distribution of GSI (tree.out.pdf):

**Command example:**
```
python2 GSI.py -t tree.nwk -o tree.out -g "gr1[a1,a2,a3,a4];gr2[b1,b2,b3,b4]" -c tree.names
```

To see all possible option, run python script with --help option: `python script.py --help`


# Future options:
1. Impelement filter by bootstrap values: (ete2: TreeNode.support)
2. Resolve polytomies (ete2: resolve_polytomy)
3. Set root on fly (ete2: TreeNode.set_outgroup)
