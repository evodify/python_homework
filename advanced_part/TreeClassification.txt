Field: data processing tool
Name: Phylogenetic trees classification
This script classifies phylogenetic trees based on phylogenetic position of different taxa. Primarily, it checks if the given set of names form monophilectic clade. In addition, it can also evaluate if trees are well supported given the bootstrap values. 
This script can be useful to identify introgressed genomic regions.

Input: 1) file with many trees in the newick format. 2) table of trees postilion on a genome 3) group1, group2
Output: 1) A table with tree position in the genome and assigned gsi values. 2) visualized results with historam.

Object: tree, group1, group2
Method: genealogical sorting index (GSI) . See Cummings et al. (2008).
Attributes: leaves, nodes, group1-2 names

Pseudo-code:
1. check if a tree is in correct format.
# t = Tree("tree.nwk", format=1)
2. ? assign nodes names
# TreeNode.name or The TreeNode.add_feature()
3. iterate through leaves containng a group and count unique nodes:
4. Calculate GSI

User case:
...

Future options:
1. impelement flter by bootstrap values: TreeNode.support
2. Resolve polytomies
# resolve_polytomy()
3. set root on fly
# TreeNode.set_outgroup()
4.
